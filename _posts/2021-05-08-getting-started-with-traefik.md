On May 8, 2021, I was fortunate to team up with [Phil Fenstermacher](https://twitter.com/pcfens) from William & Mary to provide an overview of reverse proxies and how Traefik just makes things so much easier/better, especially in containerized environments. We go through quite a few topics, covering reverse proxies in general, running Traefik locally with Docker, Kubernetes ingress, auto-cert provisioning with LetsEncrypt, and more!
