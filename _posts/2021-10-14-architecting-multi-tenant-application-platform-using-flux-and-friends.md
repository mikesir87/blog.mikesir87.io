On Oct. 14, 2021, I had the privilege of presenting at Flux's KubeCon NA booth! In this presentation, we shared some of the "behind-the-scenes" of how we are using Flux to help build out Virginia Tech's Common Application Platform. We share details about how we manage the Flux configuration objects, using our Landlord Helm chart. 

Finally, we also show off the dashboard we built, which is custom-tailored towards users of the platform, rather than administrators of the cluster.
